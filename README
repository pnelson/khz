Aspiring to be an easy-to-share drum loop application written in Ember. This is
still a work in progress as I get time. I'm using it to learn Ember and the
Grunt toolchain.

This is my first Ember application and I don't do much client-side development.
If anybody happens to stumble across this, please point out all my mistakes
either by pull request or email.
