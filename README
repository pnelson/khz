kHz
===

A hypershareable drum loop application written in Ember. This started as a means
of learning Ember and the Grunt toolchain. I also ended up learning a bit about
the HTML5 web audio API (sorry Internet Explorer users).

This is my first Ember application and I don't do much client-side development.
If anybody happens to stumble across this, please point out all my mistakes
either by pull request or email.
